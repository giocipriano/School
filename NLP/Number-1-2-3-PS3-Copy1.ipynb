\\'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing Nothing \\'cause for- a brain that is amazing Not complainin\\', but the best part of life is not even livin\\' it Love sleepin\\' and just usin\\' the internet But my time is limited, and I better figure this Before I\\'m slippin\\' this opportunity, out my fingertips And let me just tell you what I have came to do Tryna\\' show you I can rap as fast as I\\'m able to Tryna\\' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I\\'m breakin\\' through And if a major record label is looking at me I\\'m a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats I can rap fast, and rap slow I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so I\\'m like MJ back when he had the afro Also, I\\'m not black, so.. maybe not But before everyone gets angry, stop I\\'m that person, then people naturally hate me, block All the people who keep on going crazy off \\'Cause I won\\'t be making amazing songs in a mainstream, I\\'ve Got a lot of prominent features, I\\'m a confident speaker With some dominant teachers I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers I\\'m awfully small-achiever when I\\'m up on the spot, and eager They be fearin\\' this every time that they hearin\\' it To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin\\' a pyramid So when you\\'re nearin\\' this, please let me know When I\\'m standin\\' here frozen, please let it go Hear the metronome combined in the compilation To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation But that is just a dream, and probably a combination Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in But when I\\'m playin\\', just know it\\'s all a big game I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name But when you think about it, it is all insane What can be created from chemicals in this brain But when you look at me, you lackin\\' respect When I\\'m crackin\\' my neck so that I can rap to my chest Has in a breath, some say that it\\'s magic, I step Until I\\'m on the same stage, and you have it again But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame You think about how people used to sit and call you names And you check and wonder if it will be all the same Step back into reality, it all remains, damn  [Interlude 3] Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now On my computer-\\'s breaking while I\\'m doing this thirty-thousands words shit Hold on, uh Goddamn it  [Verse 13] My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin\\' just what I mean This is off the top, I don\\'t need to use no machines Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can\\'t do it forever But I am very clever, okay, okay I\\'m gonna take a drink, if you\\'re watching this, take a drink too These are some shit that you can drink to But drink water unless you\\'re of age You know what I\\'m saying? Ayy  [Interlude 4] Okay, okay Uh Uh Ayy  [Verse 14] I feel like I\\'m way too different, ridiculous And most of humanity\\'s made of idiots I barely even get myself, and you thinkin\\' you understand? You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand? Please... what I do is barely poetry There\\'s hope for me, I\\'m noticing people starting to notice me But still consider me confident Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin\\' It\\'s tragic and not fleetin\\', it follows me all evening It\\'s calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away Yeah, we\\'re just tryna find a great escape To get away from how we\\'re living life day-to-day Some people find it in a drink, or in a cup Or in some bling, or in a drug, or in the things that give us love But all I know is that it\\'s tough And all I know is that this stuff isn\\'t enough; it\\'s way too much  [Verse 15] I\\'m Jong and Ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper? These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players That shit will make me go, but I\\'m aiming high, and you aiming low Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be [?], but I came to show What I can do when I get on the mic, and I\\'m keeping it moving, you said I\\'m the hype And I\\'m seeing it through in success [?] inside, I don\\'t take it for granted with plans in this life -Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2:00 a.m. in my head in the lights Ahead of the best of \\'em, lettin\\' the rest of \\'em go off to bed in the night -Getting it like I be livin\\' in first class, I know that you never will surpass -Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast Remember the memos they sendin\\' and sendin\\' again and again  and they never will end it And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected Take a deep breath, \\'cause I need that Most of y\\'all don\\'t even care what I\\'m saying, you really just like how I speak fast My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors You want better cores and better cars, but you don\\'t know what I\\'m headin\\' towards Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain\\'t thinkin\\' of this I\\'m ingin\\' and rappin\\', and makin\\' it happen and makin\\' you laugh when I\\'m bringin\\' this shit Tryna find the other way, y\\'all just waiting for another day \\'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?

\\'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing Nothing \\'cause for- a brain that is amazing Not complainin\\', but the best part of life is not even livin\\' it Love sleepin\\' and just usin\\' the internet But my time is limited, and I better figure this Before I\\'m slippin\\' this opportunity, out my fingertips And let me just tell you what I have came to do Tryna\\' show you I can rap as fast as I\\'m able to Tryna\\' show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I\\'m breakin\\' through And if a major record label is looking at me I\\'m a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats I can rap fast, and rap slow I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so I\\'m like MJ back when he had the afro Also, I\\'m not black, so.. maybe not But before everyone gets angry, stop I\\'m that person, then people naturally hate me, block All the people who keep on going crazy off \\'Cause I won\\'t be making amazing songs in a mainstream, I\\'ve Got a lot of prominent features, I\\'m a confident speaker With some dominant teachers I deserve to be starter, but constantly on the bleachers I\\'m awfully small-achiever when I\\'m up on the spot, and eager They be fearin\\' this every time that they hearin\\' it To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin\\' a pyramid So when you\\'re nearin\\' this, please let me know When I\\'m standin\\' here frozen, please let it go Hear the metronome combined in the compilation To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation But that is just a dream, and probably a combination Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in But when I\\'m playin\\', just know it\\'s all a big game I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name But when you think about it, it is all insane What can be created from chemicals in this brain But when you look at me, you lackin\\' respect When I\\'m crackin\\' my neck so that I can rap to my chest Has in a breath, some say that it\\'s magic, I step Until I\\'m on the same stage, and you have it again But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame You think about how people used to sit and call you names And you check and wonder if it will be all the same Step back into reality, it all remains, damn  [Interlude 3] Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now On my computer-\\'s breaking while I\\'m doing this thirty-thousands words shit Hold on, uh Goddamn it  [Verse 13] My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin\\' just what I mean This is off the top, I don\\'t need to use no machines Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can\\'t do it forever But I am very clever, okay, okay I\\'m gonna take a drink, if you\\'re watching this, take a drink too These are some shit that you can drink to But drink water unless you\\'re of age You know what I\\'m saying? Ayy  [Interlude 4] Okay, okay Uh Uh Ayy  [Verse 14] I feel like I\\'m way too different, ridiculous And most of humanity\\'s made of idiots I barely even get myself, and you thinkin\\' you understand? You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand? Please... what I do is barely poetry There\\'s hope for me, I\\'m noticing people starting to notice me But still consider me confident Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness But honestly, all of this, is haunting me, probably It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin\\' It\\'s tragic and not fleetin\\', it follows me all evening It\\'s calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away Yeah, we\\'re just tryna find a great escape To get away from how we\\'re living life day-to-day Some people find it in a drink, or in a cup Or in some bling, or in a drug, or in the things that give us love But all I know is that it\\'s tough And all I know is that this stuff isn\\'t enough; it\\'s way too much  [Verse 15] I\\'m Jong and Ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
