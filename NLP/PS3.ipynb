    "\n",
    "1. Take your favorite Spotify or Apple Music playlist, and use their APIs to programmatically extract the first 20 song titles. Build a dictionary that has the song index as the key, and the title as the value. Please make sure that the playlist is **NOT** an instrumental playlist. **3 pts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the Genius API to programmatically download the lyrics of these songs and store them in a dictionary with the index as the key, and the lyrics as the value. **3 pts.**\n",

    "3. Build a 20x20 matrix containing the cosine similarities of the songs to each other. Use Bag of Words to determine these similarities. **4 pts.**\n",

    "4. Build a 20x20 matrix containing the cosine similarities of the songs to each other. Use TFIDF scores to determine these similarities. **5 pts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare the similarities using BoW and TFIDF. Analyze the results and discuss any findings that interest you. You can use heatmaps or other plots to present your analysis. **3 pts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Guide Questions:\n",
    "- Can this be used to determine playlist quality?\n",
    "- What does this say about the homogeneity of the playlist themes?\n",
    "- What does this say about how songs (in that playlist genre) are written?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identify the top 5 most important words for each song using TFIDF. Discuss the relationship of these words to their respective songs and analyze if they can be used as passable summaries of the songs. **2 pts** \n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to remove stopwords. No need to lemmatize or stem, but is very welcome.\n",
    "       \n",
    "### Bonus:\n",
    "Do a TFIDF analysis for a single artist's top 5 songs. Identify the top 10 most important words and discuss an analysis of these. **5 pts.**"
